The leisurely cruise along the famous backwaters of Kerala gives one a first-hand experience of the village lifestyle in the state and its rustic activities like coir-making and prawn farming. You cannot miss the breathtaking view of the water, land, birds and human habitation on the water side, coexisting peacefully.

The hub of backwater tourism in Kerala, Alleppey or Alappuzha means land between the sea where a network of rivers flows into it. If you are in Alleppey, perhaps your main reason to be there is to cruise through the backwaters in Kerala.Backwater by definition means “a part of a river not reached by the current, where the water is stagnant”, and Kerala showcases a lot of its picturesque backwaters in Alleppey.
