			 Kerala Trip
Dear Kerala Travels, Thank you for arranging a very beautiful trip to Kerala for us. We enjoyed every moment of it! Special thanks to our driver, Joys, who was excellent at his job and knew where all the good restaurants, boating areas, shops, spice gardens etc. were located. He was also very patient with our late schedules, long photo sessions and motion sickness that affected all of us when we were travelling in the hills. :D Our stay at Kochi in Hotel Legacy was very comfortable. Good food and warm ambience. However, Archana Residency in Munnar was just okay. While its location was good, the rooms and washrooms need to be refurbished. Stay at Thekkady in Hotel Seasons was again comfortable. But they need to widen their menu options for meals. Several items mentioned in menu were not actually available in their kitchen. Green Palace Health Resort in Allepey was very beautiful as far as location was concerned. But locks on glass doors were not working (had to shift to other rooms next day), service was very slow and food provided to us was bad. We had actually hoped to find good sea food there but it was very disappointing. Since the hotel is located on an island and is very far from Allepey city, we could not go to some other restaurant for meals. Hopefully, the hotel will improve on their food and service, so that guests can have a really wonderful time there. Despite our food troubles, thanks to our ever-cheerful driver Joys and the scenic beauty around us, we had an absolutely wonderful time visiting Kerala. Will definitely recommend Kerala Travels to our friends and family. Thanks Roli Srivastava, Priyanka Nawale, Geeta Negi, Sukanya Nawale, Parmita Srivastava
