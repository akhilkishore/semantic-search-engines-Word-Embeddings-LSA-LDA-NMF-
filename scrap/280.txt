  Kerala boasts of a long tradition of performing and ritual arts. Religious and social history contributes in the origin of these arts and thus makes them a part of the social life of an average Malayali. The performing and ritual arts of Kerala are very much a part of the religious Festivals and social events. These arts are handed down generation after generation
The themes of these art forms are generally religious. Hence they tug the heartstrings of the common man. Traditionally these art forms were performed in temples or in social gatherings such as marriages, Festivals like Onam and Thiruvatirai etc. Some of these performances were night long events and hence led to social bonding and interaction. Many of these arts are dying out slowly, either due to the secrecy maintained in olden days, with regard to imparting them or due to a lack of interest and initiative on the part of the younger generations to learn these and keep them alive. The Government and other cultural organizations are working hard to keep the performing arts of Kerala thriving. Competitions are held, artists are provided for with pension and the artistry generally encouraged
