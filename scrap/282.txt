  In the ancient times, Kerala had been a center of extreme political activity and because of its strategic location beside the Arabian Sea, the land had witnessed the invasion of several foreign powers. Kerala has a rich repertoire of historic and cultural monuments. In regions like Fort Kochi which was a trade centre for centuries, the architecture is a curious mix of typical Kerala, European, Chinese, Jewish and Arabic styles. But the most prevalent architectural style is the traditional Kerala style-nalukkettu or ettukettu.
