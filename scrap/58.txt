  Kerala's proximity to the Western Ghats and its sprawling forests has ensured that there are a large number of waterfalls adorning the landscape. They splash down the mountains leaving all who view them enchanted by the sheer magnitude and picturesque quality they possess. From picnics to excursions to simple nature walks, these are special zones where time stops to marvel at the breath-taking creations of nature. We offer you high-definition pictures that range from Athirappalli Falls, the most famous waterfall of the area to the tourist hotspot at Meenmutty Waterfalls. Our collection brings all these places to life. You can view and download the pictures at your convenience from the links below.
