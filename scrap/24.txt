  Beaches are about feeling one’s own heart beat frantically as a mighty being pulsates right in front of us. The ebbs and flows of our existence become one with sea, and that is why the few who make the trip to Kappil Beach, swear by it at all times. It is famous for its seclusion and rightly so. Large spaces of pristine sand and a divine water body in front with no other disturbance whatsoever is something people seek in growing numbers these days. Among the finest and cleanest beaches in God’s Own Country, this is a destination perfect for those who seek solitude and a place to face their own selves in peace.
