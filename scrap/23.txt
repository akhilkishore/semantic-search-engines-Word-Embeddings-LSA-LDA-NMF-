  Across Southern Kerala, people sing praises of the architectural marvel that is the Kanakakkunnu Palace in Thiruvananthapuram. Located at the heart of the city, it plays a welcoming host to a multitude of cultural events, seminars and programmes. Its proximity to a number of important tourist sites, including the Napier Museum and Trivandrum Zoo, has made it an important part of the daily workings of the city. Once host to many an important gala, under the reign of the erstwhile ruler of Travancore Sree Moolam Thirunal, it is an integral part of city’s festivities and heritage to this day.
