  Kerala is a melting pot where many religions have co-existed peacefully for centuries. Many holy sites that are integral to their followers have flourished here. They attract many devotees throughout the year and hence we have a comprehensive visual representation of the same. These high resolution visuals will give you an idea about these pilgrim centres and the massive number of followers who visit them every year from both inside the country and across the world. It is our pride to be able to host such a diverse array of religious beliefs on our shores and we welcome all who visit these divine halls.
