This uninhabited island is covered with a canopy of coconut palms and dense bushes, surrounded by mainland rivers on three sides and the sea on the other. One can approach it only at low tide, and strolls around the place give one a brilliant view of the confluence of the Anjarakandy and Thalassery Rivers.
