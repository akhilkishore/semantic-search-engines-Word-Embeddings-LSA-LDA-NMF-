  The Kerala backwaters are a chain of brackish lagoons and lakes lying parallel to the Arabian Sea coast of Kerala.The network includes five large lakes linked by canals and rivers, both manmade and natural, fed by 38 rivers, and extending virtually half the length of Kerala. The backwaters of Kerala have a unique ecosystem â€“ freshwater from the rivers meets the seawater from the Arabian Sea in the backwaters in Kerala.Many unique species of aquatic life live in and alongside the backwaters in Kerala.
